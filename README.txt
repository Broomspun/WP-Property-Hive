PropertyHive is estate agency software for WordPress. Use it to simply market you properties on the website, or expand the features through additional add-ons

== Description ==

PropertyHive is the first plugin that aims to bring all of the features you'd normally find in estate agency software into WordPress.

From managing properties, owners and landlords, to tracking applicants and matching them to suitable properties, we want to do it all.

= Why PropertyHive? =

There are many estate agency software options available on the market, but here's why we think you'll love PropertyHive:

**Millions of developers**
PropertyHive isn't developed by one person, or a small team. It's built by the world. PropertyHive is open-source meaning anyone can contribute, regardless of which country they're in, or how much existing knowledge of the plugin they have already. 

Want to build a new feature? Maybe fix a bug you've found? As long as you have an understanding of PHP and WordPress, or know someone that does, you can make the changes yourself. What's more, your hard work will be received gratefully by everyone else that uses the plugin.

**Only use the features your business needs**
By default PropertyHive is a marketing tool, allowing you to manage your property stock and list properties on your website. Through use of premium add-ons however, you can choose which features you want to bolt on. The add-ons fit seamlessly into the existing plugin, and with each other.

Want to record applicants and their requirements? There's an add-on for that. 
Want to send your properties to property portals? There's an add-on for that.

Our add-ons are priced individually from just £150 meaning you only pay for what you use.

You can [view all of our add-ons](http://wp-property-hive.com/add-ons/ "PropertyHive Add-Ons") on our website.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of PropertyHive, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “PropertyHive” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our eCommerce plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the PropertyHive plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
